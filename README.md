# build-a-computer-architecture

This repo contains my implementations of the projects from the book "The Elements of Computing Systems - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" by Noam Nisan
and Shimon Schocken, and its official website https://www.nand2tetris.org/.

The focus of this repository is using a hardware simulator to build the architecture of a fully functioning general purpose computer, starting from building elementary logic
gates.
