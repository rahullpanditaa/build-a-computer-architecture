At the beginning, only a NAND chip is taken as a primitive. Everything other logic gate/chip is constructed using NAND gates and/or other logic gates.

An OR logic gate/chip implementation.

CHIP Or {
    IN a, b;
    OUT out;

    PARTS:
    Not(in= a, out= Nota);
    Not(in= b, out= Notb);
    Nand(a= Nota, b= Notb, out= out);
}
